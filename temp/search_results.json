      "content": "As technology continues to advance, machine learning models have become increasingly powerful in solving a wide range of tasks. Fine-tuning a model is one such technique that allows us to adapt pre-trained neural network models for specific tasks or datasets. In this blog post, we will delve into what fine-tuning is, why it is used, and how it can be done effectively. What is Fine-Tuning? Fine-tuning in deep learning is a form of transfer learning.",

This helps prevent drastic changes to the already learned representations while allowing the model to adapt to the new data. 5. Fine-Tuning Strategies Every task and dataset is unique, and it may require further experimentation with hyperparameters, loss functions, and other training strategies.",
